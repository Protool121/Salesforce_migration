SalesRunner:

Salesrunner is a Python application designed for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes between Salesforce, AWS S3, and PostgreSQL databases. It utilizes Boto3 library to interact with AWS S3 for file storage and the Salesforce API for data extraction and manipulation. 

Salesrunner efficiently extracts data from Salesforce, transforms it when necessary, and loads it into an S3 bucket or a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it can extract data from S3 or a PostgreSQL database, transform it, and load it back into Salesforce. This application facilitates seamless data migration and synchronization between these platforms, making it an essential tool for managing and integrating your Salesforce data with other systems.

This updated description emphasizes Salesrunner's ability to perform ETL/ELT operations, highlights the systems it can interact with, and outlines the overall purpose and benefits of using Salesrunner for managing Salesforce data.
